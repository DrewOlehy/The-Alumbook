<br />
On each User page, the information should be displayed in three different sections: User Info, Employer Info, Surveys.

All Users, Graduate Office, and the Administrator should have an always-visible navigation area that displays the different actions available to them. Only the Administrator will have the ability to add, update, and delete any account. A Graduate Office account can only add or update a User account.

Users need the abilities to (1) choose whether their information is associated with survey responses in order to keep their responses anonymous, (2) access their account settings, and (3) in some way be able to opt-out of the following three categories of automated email that may be sent: All, Surveys, News.

There must be a password reset option. The Administrator or Graduate Office can reset user passwords. Only the Administrator can reset Graduate Office account passwords.
<br /><br /><hr />

### 2b. Giving Back

Users have the ability to submit opportunities to give back or help North Central College in some way. Possible options include internships, guest speaking, mentoring, or some other non-monetary form of assistance.

When this form is submitted, designated Graduate Office accounts will receive a notification so that they can decide if they want to follow up with the User.
<br /><br /><hr />

### 3. Surveys

When Users first sign up, they will need to fill out an entry survey. When they have graduated, an exit survey will become available. A Graduate Office account will be able to view which Users have not completed specific surveys.

When a User logs into the system, a list of available surveys will be displayed.

Graduate Office accounts need to be able to create new surveys with the option to make them available to certain groups of Users.
<br /><br /><hr />

### 4. Reports

There needs to be the ability to create reports based on survey results and search queries with a number of preset options. There should also be the ability to create custom reports. A Graduate Office account should be able to export these reports into Excel spreadsheet format for easier viewing and management.
<br /><br /><hr />

### 5. Admin

The Administrator will be the only account that is able to create, update, or delete both Graduate Office and User accounts.
<br /><br /><hr />

### 6. Search & Saved Lists

<strong>Graduate Office Employees:</strong><br />
The Graduate Office has the ability to search through the database information by any of the information that a User has provided to their account. After a search has been completed, the Graduate Office should be able to save individual users to a Saved List. The information displayed in a search result should be limited to name, degree program, email, employer, graduation date, and any other fields the Graduate Office account used to search to not clutter the screen. The Saved Lists need to be exportable into an Excel spreadsheet, along with their emails for use in sending group emails via Groupwise.

<strong>Users:</strong><br />
The User has the ability to search for other Users if they have opted-in to searches from other Users. Only basic fields such as name and degree should be shown.
